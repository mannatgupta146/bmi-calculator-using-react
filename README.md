# BMI Calculator

This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator built using React. The app allows users to enter their weight and height, calculates their BMI, and provides a message indicating whether they are underweight, at a healthy weight, or overweight.

- **User Feedback**: Displays a message based on the BMI:
  - **Underweight**: BMI less than 20
  - **Healthy weight**: BMI between 20 and 25
  - **Overweight**: BMI greater than or equal to 25
- **Reset Functionality**: Users can reset the form and reload the page with a "Reload" button.
- **Responsive Design**: The app adjusts to different screen sizes for a better user experience.

## How It Works
1. **Input**: The user enters their weight (in kg) and height (in meters) in the provided input fields.
2. **BMI Calculation**: When the user submits the form, the app calculates the BMI based on the entered data.
